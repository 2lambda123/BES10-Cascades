        The Submit Expense and Expense Report applications work together to allow 
        seamless managing of expense submissions. First, the employee uses the Submit 
        Expense application to create an expense report, attach their receipts as images, 
        and send their expenses. The Expense Report application allows the manager to 
        see, to approve or to reject the submissions. The manager can also invoke BBM to 
        discuss directly with the employee.

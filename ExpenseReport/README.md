Exspense Report
===============

Expense Report - Expense Report is BlackBerry 10 native demo app.  This demo application was created in partnership with Macadamian (http://www.macadamian.com/).  Although this demo application stands on its own it has minor integration with the Submit Expense demo application.

This application demonstrates how you can quickly create a Cascades BlackBerry 10 enterprise application to mobilize common business use cases.  

The Submit Expense demo application shows the expense submitter's use cases while the Expense Report demo application shows the approvers user cases.  The demo applications can stand completely on their own but if both are installed on the same device when the submitter submits an expense report a notification will appear in the hub which if opened will launch the Expense Report application.
